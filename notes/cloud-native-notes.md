# Notes on Cloud Native apps

Three key principles fo Cloud native apps

- Distrupt
- Industrialize

Hyperscale, traffic, data, features etc.

You need app to handle lots of scale

**antifragility** cloud native apps don't break anywhere, no single point of failure.

cloud native --> continous delivery and devops

**opex savings** automation and utilization. Only pay for what you use.

packaged, distributed in containers.

## Design challenges

CHange to reactive programming, needs to be designed to automation. For continous delivery, need automation and elasticity. The apps should not break and be fault tolerant and dynamically scale up and down. Elastic, so they scale up and down dynamically to changes in environment. Also you need complex logging and services to debug when things go wrong.
